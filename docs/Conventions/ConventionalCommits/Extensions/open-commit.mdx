All the commits in this repo are done with OpenCommit â€” look into [the commits](https://github.com/di-sukharev/opencommit/commit/eae7618d575ee8d2e9fff5de56da79d40c4bc5fc) to see how OpenCommit works. Emoji and long commit description text is configurable.

## Setup

1. Install OpenCommit globally to use in any repository:

   ```sh
   npm install -g opencommit
   ```

2. Get your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Make sure you add payment details, so API works.

3. Set the key to OpenCommit config:

   ```sh
   opencommit config set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
   ```

   Your api key is stored locally in `~/.opencommit` config file.

## Usage

You can call OpenCommit directly to generate a commit message for your staged changes:

```sh
git add <files...>
opencommit
```

You can also use the `oc` shortcut:

```sh
git add <files...>
oc
```

## Features

### Preface commits with emoji ðŸ¤ 

[GitMoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) convention is used.

To add emoji:

```sh
oc config set emoji=true
```

To remove emoji:

```sh
oc config set emoji=false
```

### Postface commits with descriptions of changes

To add descriptions:

```sh
oc config set description=true
```

To remove description:

```sh
oc config set description=false
```

### Internationalization support

To specify the language used to generate commit messages:

```sh
# de, German ,Deutsch
oc config set language=de
oc config set language=German
oc config set language=Deutsch

# fr, French, franÃ§aise
oc config set language=fr
oc config set language=French
oc config set language=franÃ§aise
```
The default language set is **English**  
All available languages are currently listed in the [i18n](https://github.com/di-sukharev/opencommit/tree/master/src/i18n) folder

### Git flags

The `opencommit` or `oc` commands can be used in place of the `git commit -m "${generatedMessage}"` command. This means that any regular flags that are used with the `git commit` command will also be applied when using `opencommit` or `oc`.

```sh
oc --no-verify
```

is translated to :

```sh
git commit -m "${generatedMessage}" --no-verify
```

### Ignore files
You can ignore files from submission to OpenAI by creating a `.opencommitignore` file. For example:

```ignorelang
path/to/large-asset.zip
**/*.jpg
```

This is useful for preventing opencommit from uploading artifacts and large files.

By default, opencommit ignores files matching: `*-lock.*` and `*.lock`

## Git hook

You can set OpenCommit as Git [`prepare-commit-msg`](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_prepare_commit_msg) hook. Hook integrates with you IDE Source Control and allows you edit the message before commit.

To set the hook:

```sh
oc hook set
```

To unset the hook:

```sh
oc hook unset
```

To use the hook:

```sh
git add <files...>
git commit
```

Or follow the process of your IDE Source Control feature, when it calls `git commit` command â€” OpenCommit will integrate into the flow.
