The Antsomi API uses [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) for member (user) authorization and API authentication. Applications must be authorized and authenticated before they can fetch data from Antsomi.

There are two types of Authorization Flows available:

- Member Authorization (3-legged OAuth)
- Application Authorization (2-legged OAuth)

Depending on the type of permissions your integration will require, follow one of the authorization flows to get started.
